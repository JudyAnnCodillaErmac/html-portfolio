<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>A musical movie that capture the heart of most of the people in the world. I really love the movie.</p>
<h3>Miracle in Cell No. 7</h3>
<p>The most inspiring movie. You realize the innocence of the child and its love towards her father. A very PURE love indeed.</p>
<h3>The Three Idiots</h3>
<p>All is Well. The famous tag line in the movie. All throughout the movie you will laugh, cry, feel worry and excitement,
     as well as proud and be motivated in life</p>
