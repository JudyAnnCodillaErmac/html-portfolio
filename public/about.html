<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Good day! <br/>
   Judy Ann Codilla Ermac at your service. 
   I am licensed professional teacher. 
   Graduated in Mindanao State University with the program of Bachelor of Secondary Education major in Mathematics with latin honor as a Cum Laude last June 2018.
</p>

<p>I am now a certified  full time Mama with my two little angel. 
  As of this moment I am learning how to code!
  Good luck for me as I take this new learning path of my life.
  Indeed, Learning has no limit. It is infinite. It has no end. We live, we Learn.

<p>I want to take this opportunity to THANK my MENTOR, Ms. Catherine B. Maglasang.
   Thank you so much on sharing knowledge. </p>
